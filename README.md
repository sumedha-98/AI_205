Noyes Palmer Chapman created and popularized the 8-puzzle problem in the 1870s. On a 3-by-3 grid, there are 8 square blocks with the numbers 1 through 8 and one blank square. 
The blocks must be rearranged in the desired arrangement for you to succeed. Blocks may be slid into the empty square either horizontally or vertically. 
The following diagram illustrates a series of initial states of the 8 puzzle. The diagram with depth 0 is the goal state.
This is the first project for the course CS205(Artificial Intelligence) in University of California, Riverside. This has been assigned by Professor Eamonn Keogh for the Spring quarter of 2023.
This project involves solving the 8-puzzle using three search algorithms: Uniform Cost Search, A* Misplaced tile heuristic search and A* Manhattan distance heuristic search.

To run the code, we run the command "python 3 8_puzzle_project_1.py".
